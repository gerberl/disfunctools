# `disfunctools`

My own tiny humble extension to `itertools`, `functools`, and the like, primarily for my own projects. 

## Installation

The easiest is probably to clone the github repo and `pip install -e .` from the local, top directory of the cloned repo.


## Test

`test.py` aims to illustrate some use cases.
