# `disfunctools`

My own tiny humble extension to `itertools`, `functools`, and the like, primarily for my own projects. 


## Installation

To add it to your local instalaltion, probably the easiest is:

`pip install git+https://github.com/gerberl/disfunctools.git`

If you'd like to edit it locally, probably best to `git clone` it and then `pip install -e .` from the package's root directory.


## Test

`test.py` aims to illustrate some use cases.
